        Once Victoria stood in front of all of us and broke her silence, students at Denison have broken their own silence and pledged to make changes to improve their mental health. Victoriaâ€™s vulnerability in sharing her story has empowered Denison students, she directly impacted the lives of over 200 people.

        The motivating inspirators that I most admire have the following characteristics.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Outrageously courageous - they disturb the status quo and define a new normal</li>
        <li>Motivate others - people follow a great leader</li>
        <li>Big footprint - impact on millions and change the world</li>
        <li>Sacrifice & commitment - their impact usually costs them everything</li>
        <li>Integrity - they live true to their calling</li>
    </ul>
